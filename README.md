# Self-Sovereign AI: A Decentralized Framework for Autonomous, Privacy-Preserving Artificial Intelligence ðŸ¤–

The concept of Self-Sovereign AI proposes a framework for creating autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) that operates independently, manages its own data, and engages in secure, decentralized interactions without reliance on centralized control. This AI system utilizes decentralized identifiers (DIDs), Nostr, Pubky, decentralized storage, federated learning, and privacy-preserving technologies to provide a foundation for AI systems that respect user privacy, ensure data sovereignty, and maintain high levels of transparency. Such a system could be applied across various fields, from financial services to decentralized data marketplaces and healthcare, where independence and security are paramount.
